      <p id="concept">
        The initial concept of 'Black Rose' was a place so far into the unknown
        that no singular judgment could be taken seriously,
        and no prejudice would make any sense.
        It was meant for those who were so tired of so much and desired no overjoy,
        but enough—a place to rest and enjoy.
        There was no need to search for a greater purpose,
        for existence itself would be one's satisfaction,
        one's justification to be.
      </p>
      <p id="truth">
        The black rose is, indeed, no more than a concept.
        Its own existence is a lie, roughly speaking,
        as what we perceive as "black", in nature,
        is merely a darker pigmentation of other typical colours,
        such as red and purple, bringing some people to the extent of
        dyeing roses black in persuit of their unnatural beauty.
      </p>
      <p id="comeback">
        With time, this concept adapted
        -- morphed into a more realistic derivation.
        Those who sought freedom found it and much more.
        Amidst the comfort of nothingness, they stood in contemplation.
        Peeking inside their own void, they reacquired the long-lost desire.
        The pursuit of meaning stole their lust and will,
        leaving nothing but a blind, regretful shell,
        brought back to life by the erstwhile insufferable silence.
      </p>
      <p id="together">
        And they opened their eyes,
        each at their own pace and within their own comfort.
        After regaining sight, they looked around.
        Inspiration, devotion, desire—we had it all. We had each other.
